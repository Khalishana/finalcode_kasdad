This is the source code for the final assignment of Artificial Intelligence and Basic Data Science course, which involves conducting data exploration to identify health admission trends. This project performs exploratory data analysis on various patient demographics, such as age, lifestyle habits, and disease outcomes, to uncover insights into health trends. As a team member, my responsibilities include executing data preparation tasks and developing classification, regression, and clustering models using machine learning algorithms, such as Decision Trees, Linear Regression, and K-Means Clustering in order to achieve accurate predictions and enhance data-driven decision-making.
